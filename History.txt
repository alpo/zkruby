=== 3.4.3 /

* Tidy up 

  * simplify require statements (zkruby or em_zkruby)

  * no need to separately require util recipes for recursive mkpath/rmpath

  * specs can be run independently

  * fix dependencies so rake newb works

  * Use standard major.minor.build versioning. Major/Minor will track ZooKeeper itself, build is zkruby's

=== 3.4.2.0 / 2012-02/05

* First gem release. Tested against Zookeeper 3.4.2, and 3.3.3
